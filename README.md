# Liver Tumor Volume Calculation from Medical Imaging Data

This repository contains the implementation and experiments for my Master's thesis: "Calculation of Liver Tumor Volume from Medical Imaging Data". The project investigates the capabilities of selected neural network architectures in segmenting liver and tumor regions in CT scans and calculating tumor volumes based on segmented masks.

The primary goal of the thesis is to evaluate the performance of four neural network architectures in segmenting liver and tumor regions from medical imaging data and calculating the volumes of tumors. 
The work utilizes data from the Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS7), comprising 130 CT scans and corresponding liver and tumor masks.

The primary challenge is to identify a network model that accurately delineates tumor areas.

This study utilizes the open-source tool OpenMMLab and its MMSegmentation library for semantic segmentation. Preprocessing steps are also performed to enhance the quality and contrast of the data.
